# 4 kinds of danger

- No danger (eg. You're in a bank lobby)
- Subtle danger (eg. You're in a bank vault, and the guards are unaware)
- Imminent danger (eg. You're in a bank vault, and the guards are aware and on their way)
- Present danger (eg. You're in a bank vault, and so are the guards)

# Flashback Tokens

Got a token? That's worth spending on a flashback. Instead of massive amounts of setup or filling out every crew member on every detail (and because that's what makes the Ocean's movies so fun), prep can be discovered through the course of play with the use of flashback tokens. Everyone starts out with 2, and prepwork and really good decisions lead to them gaining more tokens.

The number of tokens that are spent is based on the level of danger.
- 1 during Subtle danger
- 2 during Imminent danger
- 3 during Present danger
During periods of no danger, flashbacks are free.

During a flashback, the user describes the actions they took (and any important involved parties) as long as it does not conflict with a previous prep or flashback. The actions must be reasonable (plannable in advance) and adequately describe how it resolves the situation. Rolls during the flashback are made with an extra die (dropping the lowest), but failure means that whatever was setup during the flashback no longer matters (a fixed vehicle was sabotaged, the expected guard called in sick, etc). Anyone can spend their flashback tokens during a scene, even if they're not in the scene itself.

If a flashback is performed by a character that has reached their stress reserve for the day, they can still perform as if they're not stressed, but any additional stress accrued during the flashback will be added to their current value, which means it will roll over during the next day.

# Stress

Much like how I borrowed Flashbacks from Blades in the Dark, I also borrowed the stress system. However, it does not work the same way.

Every day, a certain amount of stress reserve is rolled, which is given to everyone. Stress is acquired after scenes depending on how exherting they were. Once a character has used filled their stress reserve, they will not have access to any of their abilities, and all their attributes become -1.

Stress can also be taken on in place of major failures. For example, if you're caught in an employee-only area and cannot bluff your way out, you may be beaten up and thrown out, taking on 2 stress.

If you take on a higher level of stress than your reserve, you take on the difference on the following day after reserves are re-rolled. For example, if you have 4/5 stress and take on 2 stress, you will have 1 more than your reserve. When you start the next day, you will have 1 stress before the first scene.

# Skill Checks

Skill checks (the sturdy backbone of TTRPGs everywhere) are the result of rolling 2d6 and adding the relevant attribute modifier for that skill. Many skills are associated with two attributes, which usually means either attribute can be used. For example, to determine an NPC's motivations during a conversation, an Insight check is used, which can have either cha or sly as the modifier.

The outcome of a skill roll is based on the total value of the roll:

|Value|Result|
|:-|:-|
|2-6|failure|
|7-9|mixed success|
|10-12|full success|

When the 2 dice are both 6's, it's counted as a critical success, which adds additional impact to the roll.

Failures for checks in skills that you're trained in are counted as a mixed success.
