# Character Creation

- Assign the values 2, 1, 1, 0, and -1 to the 5 attributes in any configuration.
- Choose 1 skill (unless you're a Confidence Man) and 1 ability in addition to any granted by your role
- You have reserve called stress (which is rolled for every day), which may be altered by some abilities. Every day that passes, your stress resets.

## Attributes

#### Strength
#### Dexterity
#### Intelligence
#### Charisma
#### Sly

## Roles

### Tech
Handy with a wrench or a soldering iron. Techs can handle any technology, be it dwarven or gnomish, mundane or arcane. If it has a wire, a gear, or runic programming, a tech fill find a way to break it and remake it.

- Skills: **Crafting** and either **Decipher** or **Knowledge**.
- Abilities: **Disassembly** and **Whatever you need**.

### Demolitions
What demos lack in the finesse of a sticky fingers or the charm of conman, they more than make up for it in their ability to turn almost any problem into debris.

- Skills: **Crafting** and **Awareness**. 
- Abilities: **Quick boom** and either **Sapper** or **No safe is safe**.

### Greaseman
If you need someone to squeeze into a tight space, climb absurd heights, or pirouette over traps, you'd best call your local greaseman.

- Skills: **Athletics** and **Stealth**
- Abilities: **Slippin Jimmy** and **Leap of Faith**

### Confidence Man
Both forgettable and the center of attention, the king of the con is the conman. Every ruse, scam, and heist needs someone who can act like they belong.

- Skills: **Awareness**, **Deception**, **Insight**, and **Persuasion**, but you cannot pick another skill.
- Abilities: Choose one between **I belong here**, **I know a guy**, and **Better Call Paul**

### Muscle
Big brute, or maybe a tiny guy with nunchucks. While a Muscle usually lacks the subtlety or skill found in other heist roles, they can find avenues for success through combat, intimidation, or just opening a locked door _the hard way_.

- Skills: **Athletics** and **Awareness**
- Abilities: **Slugger**, **Insurance Fraud**, and **My friend Mr. Spanner**

### Sticky Fingers
Hey, where'd my wallet go? You've been hit by, you've been struck by, a pickpocket. Nabbing the pocketwatch off a dilletante is second nature, but real sticky fingers aren't in the trade for the money. They do it for the love of the game.

- Skills: **Stealth** and **Sleight of hand**
- Abilities: **That's mine** and **No Safe is Safe**

## Skills

When you're trained in a skill, any checks you make with it cannot fail, instead earning a mixed success at a minimum.

Any check for a skill requires adding a specific attribute. While the list below details which attributes are generally added to a skill check, arguments can always be made as to using a different ability instead.

For example, if a bomb is being disassembled using a crafting check, it would normally require adding the dex score. However, it could be argued that int would be a better modifier if there are schematics for the bomb.

|Skill|Ability mod|
|-:|:-|
|**Athletics**|Add str or dex|
|**Awareness**|Add int or sly|
|**Crafting**|Add dex or int|
|**Deception**|Add cha|
|**Decipher**|Add int|
|**Insight**|Add sly or cha|
|**Knowledge**|Add int|
|**Persuasion**|Add cha|
|**Sleight of Hand**|Add sly or dex|
|**Stealth**|Add sly or dex|

## Abilities

A few abilities have the `(locked)` modifier. This ability can only be held by a single player, and it's expected that these abilities match the background of the character (eg An experienced criminal with many heists on their belt would not be a "lucky amateur").

There may be other modifiers as well, such as skill requirements.

### Disassembly (must be trained in **crafting** or **decipher**)

+2 to taking apart a contraption, though no guarantees that you'll be able to put it back together the same way.

### Whatever you need

You cannot fail at **knowledge** (int) checks for knowing where to acquire equipment.

### Quick boom (must be trained in **crafting**)

You always have the equipment to make minor explosives, ***no matter what***.

### Sapper

You can always move forward regardless of what's in the way. +2 to any checks around digging or breaking down walls.

### Slippin Jimmy

When the heat is high, you can slip out of a situation. +2 to **stealth** (sly) checks when your location is sec-level 2 or lower.

### Leap of Faith

You add +3 to **athletics** (str or dex) checks that involve jumping, leaping, soaring, or extreme hopping.

### I belong here

You have a trustworthy face. You add -1 to the sec-level every location you're currently in, except for sec-level 5.

### I know a guy

You have many friends with useful abilities. You cannot fail at **knowledge** (int) checks for knowing where to acquire personnel.

### Slugger (must be trained in **athletics**)

You cannot fail at **athletics** (str or dex) checks that involve boxing, brawling, or fisticuffs.

### Insurance Fraud (must be trained in **athletics**)

You treat **deception** checks that involves getting hurt or injured as **athletics** (str/dex) instead. You have +1 stress reserve.

### My friend Mr. Spanner

You give off a very scary vibe. You are able to intimidate others to get an item, information, etc. This is your choice between an **athletics** (str only) or **persuasion** (cha) check.

### That's mine

If you're caught with stolen goods, you can't fail **deception** (cha) checks to convince authorities that they actually belong to you.

### No safe is safe (must be trained in **sleight of hand** or **decipher**)

+2 to checks for unlocking a safe when using a non-destructive method.

### Disguise Kit

You have a disguise kit that can be used once per day and on one crew member. They get the following benefits:
- You reduce the sec-level of your location for yourself only
- You have a +2 to **deception** (cha) checks to convince someone that you're a specific person.

Once a disguise is discarded, it cannot be put back on.

### Phillip Jr.

You have an animal companion that's small enough to be concealed in a jacket (no larger than, say, a possum or something...). It dutifully follows your orders to the best of its abilities.

### Hairpin (must be trained in **sleight of hand** or **decipher**)

You have a nearly indestructable hairpin that you can contort to suit your needs, and it's always on your person. It provides a +2 bonus to unlocking a door or bypassing a security mechanism when using a non-destructive method.

### Lucky Amateur (locked)

You're new to the criminal curcuit, which means you have beginners luck. Once per day, you can turn any mixed success into a full success.

### Master of their Field (locked)

This is not your first rodeo. Once per day, you can turn any mixed success into a full success.

### Eye of the tiger

When the going gets tough, you get tougher. You have +2 to stress reserve.

### Fearless Leader (locked)

Your crew looks to you for answers and guidance. Once per scene, you can give a crew member (that can see or hear you) an extra d6 for their check, keeping the highest 2 values.

### The way he walks (must be trained in **awareness**)

You automatically identify people using disguises, though you don't necessarily identify the person behind the disguise.
